description: This portfolio was built as a headless CMS with Next.JS. Most
  content is statically generated using Netlify CMS, including this text right
  here. It's a revamp/upgrade of a previous portfolio made with Nuxt.JS and
  Netfliy CMS. I made this change to keep learning and improving and make it
  easier for myself to update my portfolio.
